# Linky

The panel for Linky, a Discord x Minecraft linking [plugin](https://github.com/linkymc/Plugin).

## Why?

Typical Discord linking solutions require a good bit of work on the developers side. Like hosting their own bot within a plugin, for example. That takes up resources and isn't the easiest for newcomers to setup.

Linky aims to improve upon this, by making the experience for both administrators AND users seemless.

## Setup

1. Head over to the [hosted version](https://linky.astrid.sh/) of the panel, and create an account.
2. Create an instance for a particular Discord server, and invite the bot.
3. Download and install the latest plugin release from [here](https://github.com/linkymc/Plugin)
4. Input your API key from the panel into `config.yml`, and you're done :)
